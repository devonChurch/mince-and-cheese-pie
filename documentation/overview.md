2. **Operable** = Interact via mouse, keyboard, touch or voice
1. **Understandable** = Cognitively clear and simple
4. **Robust** = Adaptable to scenarios like zoom
5. **Conformance** = Adhering to WCAG standards (like 2.1)

## Normative vs Non-normative

+ **Normative** = Actions that fall **inside** the bounds of laws and regulations
+ **Non-normative** = Actions that **violate** and fall **outside** the bounds of laws and regulations.
