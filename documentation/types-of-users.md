# Types of users

## Blind

### Keyboard shortcuts

Skip to the main content on the page
+ Do not want to listen through the list of primary navigation links on every pathname change.

Navigate by headings

Cycle through semantic landmarks

Skip through anchor tags

### Content

Context/sentiment of content cannot be dirrived through visual aids
+ Color
+ Size
+ Font weight
+ Images / icons *(without accessible metadata)*
+ Highlighting

All functionality must be capable using a **keyboard**
+ **Note:** Keyboard navigation can act differently when a screen reader is active
  + What are these differences?
  + Xxxx
  + Xxxx
  + Xxxx
  + Xxxx

Video content/sentiment
+ Blind users can hear audio but cannot see any nuanced context *(like the setting, a users emotion, gestures etc)*
+ [Here is an example of audio descriptors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al4FNgNvyyI) *(narrating exactly what is going on in the video at any given time)*

Feedback after creating an action
+ Silence after making an action is a bad experience
  + Form submission
  + Input change (like a select)
  + Expand/collapse
  + **Important:** Inform users that a SPA navigation has occurred
    + Is this a wide reaching problem?
    + How can we solve this?

Swipe Gestures
+ Screen readers hijack swipe gestures for themselves
+ All functionality MUST be actionable through click/touch interactions

## Low vision

There is a huge disparity between the different type of low vision issues

Color
+ Color contrast/schemes can help users establish extra visual clarity
  + Yellow / Black color schemes = Users that feel pain/discomfort from bright light (reducing the white light)
  + high contrast = Increase the differentiation of the context (text) from the background

Zoom
+ Using 3rd party (or the browser) to increase the page scale
+ **Note:** Do *NOT* disable pinch-to-zoom!
+ [An example of using a 3rd party zoom tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojtiVj78QPw)

Custom UX
+ Using 3rd party integrations to change the shape/color of
  + The mouse pointer
  + Text pointer
  + An elements focus state

Screen Readers
+ Not just for blind users, low vision users can benefit from screen readers too!
